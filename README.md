Sprint Review and Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program is a crucial part of software development. User needs refer to the requirements and expectations of the users who will be using the program. To effectively interpret user needs, it's essential to engage with the users through interviews, surveys, and other feedback mechanisms. Creating "user stories" is a technique used to capture the user's perspective and requirements. User stories are a short, simple description of a feature or functionality that is written from the user's point of view. User stories help to keep the focus on the user's needs and expectations throughout the development process, and they provide a clear understanding of what the user wants and how the program will meet those needs.


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?


When approaching program development, it's important to follow an agile process. Agile processes prioritize flexibility, collaboration, and adaptability. The goal is to develop software that meets the users' needs in a timely and cost-effective way. The agile methodology is characterized by a focus on rapid prototyping, continuous testing and delivery, and constant feedback from users.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member in software development, you need to be a good communicator, collaborator, and problem-solver. It's essential to be able to work effectively with others, take feedback constructively, and contribute to the team's success. Being a good team member also means being open to learning new things, being adaptable to change, and being accountable for your work.
